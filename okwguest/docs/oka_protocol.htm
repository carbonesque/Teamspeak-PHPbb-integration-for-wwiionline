    <td width="733"><h4>Registration:</h4>
      <p>In order to use this server, all users must register with the server
        at http://okw.wwiiol.net. Please checkout the <a href="/okwguest/docs/installts.htm">setup
        guide</a>.</p>
      <h4>Parent Channels: </h4>
      <p>Parent channels are designed for communication of a strategic or logistical
        nature. They serve the purpose of meeting rooms and seats of command
        and control. </p>
      <p>      
      <h4>Subchannels: </h4>
      <p>Each subchannel is designed for tactical communications in the field.
        A division commander may dynamically assign leaders and players to tasks
        on subchannels as necessary. Each subchannel should have a leader and
        each leader should have the <em>Channel Commander </em>toggled on to
        show who is in command and to be able to receive command channel whispers
        (CCWs) </p>
      <h3></h3>
      <h4>Whispers:</h4>
      Command channel and bound whispers make it possible for leaders at all
      levels of command to stay in touch. These whispers act as a bridge of communication
      between korps, divisions, and KGs. Whispers should be brief; remember that
      you cannot hear the chatter on the recipient's channel and you may be “talking
      over” someone else.
  <p>  
  <h4>Officer Communication Within a Division &amp; Below: </h4>
  <p>KG commanders may communicate with their division commander as
    well as each other with the Command Channel Whisper (CCW) to channel family
    command (currently F11 on the <a href="keybind.htm">keybind</a>). This functionality
    allows every division and KG within a korps to work closely with each other
    while permitting autonomy within each channel. For extended conversations
    and meetings, leaders may congregate on the korps parent channel. </p>
  <strong>Protocol: </strong>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"> “CCW.” State your name . Then transmit your message. </p>
    <strong><em>Example: </em></strong>“CCW. Fuze here. Schulz, do you read?” </blockquote>
  <p>  
  <h4>Officer Communication Between Divisions &amp; Above: </h4>
  <p>Voice communication above the division level starts with the <em>CCW to all </em>command
    (<a href="keybind.htm">keybind</a> F10). Take care to use this function sparingly
    because this broadcasts your message to every channel commander on the server,
    not just your korps channel family. After initial contact via CCW, the players
    will “bind” each other to establish a direct link. The whisper binds allow
    you to directly whisper to people on the fly. It works for the last player
    who whispered to you (whether it is a direct whisper or a CCW). You can bind
    up to three players. (or more if you wish to add more keys) </p>
  <p>The proper protocol for voice communication above the korps level begins
    with a server-wide CCW addressed to an individual. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Server CCW.” Then state your name and your korps designation. Then address
      the recipient by name. </p>
    <strong><em>Example: </em></strong>“Server CCW. Fuze, XV Korps. Dinker do
    you read?” </blockquote>
  <p>The recipient will bind the whisperer to a transmit key (<a href="keybind.htm">keybind</a>:
    CTRL + F1) then transmit back (<a href="keybind.htm">keybind</a>: F1)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> “Direct Whisper.” State your name, reply. </p>
    <strong><em>Example: </em></strong>“Direct Whisper. This is Dinker, go ahead
    Fuze.” </blockquote>
  <p>The original whisperer then binds the recipient back (<a href="keybind.htm">keybind</a>:
    CTRL + F1). This will establish a private link to each other using bound
    whispers instead of server-wide CCWs. The keybind currently has three keys
    for binding and directly whispering to three other players. If an extended
    voice conversation is necessary then all parties must agree on a particular
    parent channel to meet so as to avoid talking over each other's channels. <strong>Keep
    your server CCW transmissions short</strong>. </p>
  <p>Initial contact above the korps level can also be made via in-game chat
    on the armee channels (19, 29, 39, 49), the luftflotte channels (18, 28,
    38, 48) or the kriegsmarine channels (37, 48, 49). Remember, not everyone
    uses TS. </p>
  <p>  
  <h4>Server Security: </h4>
  <p>Our first line of defense is the requirement of registration and validation.
    Players will register from a website with their in-game name, email address,
    Branch, Korps, Div, and KG designation. GHC officers will then grant clearance
    to those users who register for their unit. There will be no unregistered
    users on the TS server. Each player will be responsible for his or her own
    account and password. </p>
  <p>The server logs all IP addresses and all admin activity. </p>
  <p>Server Admins have the ability to kick a player from the server, remove
    his account, and ban his IP address. This is a last resort. Server Admins
    may find a players IP address by right clicking on the players name and then
    clicking <em>Get Connection Info </em>. IP addresses are hidden from all
    players who are not Server Admins. </p>
  <p>  
  <h4>Channel Privileges: </h4>
  <p>KG Officers and above will be given <em>channel admin </em> (CA) status
    which will allow them flexibility in the content of the &quot;Topic&quot; and &quot;Description&quot; fields
    for information like in-game chat channels, AOs, orders, websites, special
    events, channel rules, etc. They will also be allowed to adjust the codecs
    of their channel/subchannels to fit the needs of their players (some KGs
    may have a lot of dial-up players, for example). For the sake of uniformity
    and ease of keybinding, CAs will not be allowed to change the names of the
    channels themselves. </p>
  <p>GHC Officers with .axis ability will be given <em>Server Admin </em> (SA)
    status to allow them to perform any necessary maintenance to the server.
    SAs may move players to another channel, kick players from the server, and
    ban players from the server. SAs may also view the IP addresses of players
    on the server. </p>
  <p>  
  <h4>TeamSpeak and In-Game Chat: </h4>
  <p>We cannot expect every player to use TS. Therefore commanders on tactical
    channels must take reasonable steps to include everyone working with their
    KG, not just those on TS. Orders and reports made on TS should be relayed
    on in-game chat to keep those not on TS informed. A commander may do this
    himself, or may elect a comms officer to do this for him. Naturally, CO or
    not, whoever is relaying these messages on in-game chat should avoid driving
    or flying. </p></td>
