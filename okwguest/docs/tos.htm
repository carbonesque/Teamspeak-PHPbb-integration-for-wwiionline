	IMPORTANT:  By using this server, you agree to observe these rules.  Failure to complay may be cause for removal.
      <p><br>
        1. Use of the OKA Teamspeak server is a privilege, not a right. Access  to the server, certain channels, and special admin rights are not  guaranteed. You are expected to act mature and respect other players. <br>
              <br>
        2. Use of the OKA Teamspeak server is restricted to matters relating to  the WWIIOL Axis community only. You may not use this server for other  games. You may not use this server while playing WWIIOL as Allied. <br>
              <br>
        3. Your Teamspeak account &lsquo;Login Name&rsquo; must be exactly the same as your  in-game name in WWIIOL. Your &ldquo;Nickname&rsquo; as entered in your Teamspeak  client must contain your in-game name as well, but must be preceded by  your squad name or initials. (i.e. &ldquo;6PD playername&rdquo;) <br>
              <br>
        4. You may have ONLY one account on the OKA Teamspeak server. <br>
              <br>
        5. You must logout of Teamspeak when you are not using it.  Idlers (over 2 hrs) will be kicked. <br>
              <br>
        6. Other rules may be applied by the OKW chain of command to  particular channels. These additional rules are displayed in the  information (right-hand) pane of Teamspeak. When using these channels,  you are expected to observe these rules. Some channels may disallow  cursing or other adult language. Some channels may have strict comms  protocol. <br>
              <br>
        7. OKW Officers &amp; game managers are governed under an  additional set of rules beyond those stated here. Officers are to  consult their Unit Commanders (or visit the Officer's Club) for more  details. <br>
              <br>
        The OKA Teamspeak server is not a service offered by WWIIOL or  PLAYNET, but a private server hosted &ndash;and paid for-- by Grizwald for  the benefit of the community. No payment is required to use this  server. However, operating costs are not cheap and donations are  greatly appreciated.
