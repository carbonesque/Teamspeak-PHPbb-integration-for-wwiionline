  <tr>
    <td width="734"><p>The voice-comm software we use in the game is very similar
        to CB radio communications. Only one user can speak at a time. If two
        users try to transmit at the same time, both transmissions become unintelligible.
        Take care not to interrupt other transmissions as well as keep your own
        transmissions short and to the point. </p>
      <h3>General Transmission protocol: </h3>
      <p>Begin all of your transmissions by <strong>identifying yourself</strong>.
        Do not expect other players to recognize you by your voice. It wastes
        way too much time figuring out who said &quot;matty on my tag&quot;.
        By the time we find out who you are, the matty could be gone, or killing
        you. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong><em>Example</em>: </strong>FuZe here, I have 2 a13s southeast
          of Zand AB, 500 meters inbound, Over. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>When addressing another player call their handle first, and then follow
        it with your own handle. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong><em>Example</em>:</strong> “BossHogg, this is FuZe, do you
          copy? Over” </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4><strong>SPOT Reports </strong></h4>
      <p>Contact reports or SPOT (army lingo) when you see enemy units you need
        to always give out a contact report. A major benefit of voice-comms like
        TeamSpeak is that it allows other players to know about what you see,
        and vice versa. The comm should not be abused, and you should keep your
        transmitions brief to give other players a chance to speak. Just remember
        to <strong>think </strong>before you transmit. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Size </strong>: Report the size of the force. How many tanks,
          planes, infantry? You don't have to be exact, but the more descriptive,
          the better.</p>
        <p><strong>Position </strong>: Report the position of your contact. Give
          a direction relative to a landmark or road as well as the approximate
          distance. Avoid using your tag as a landmark. </p>
        <p><strong>Observation </strong>: Describe what you see them doing and
          what direction are they heading or facing. Are they rallying? Charging?
          Hulling down?</p>
        <p><strong>Transmit </strong>: Only after you have the above info formed
          in your head do you transmit. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4><strong>Open Comms/Closed Comms: </strong></h4>
      <p>With a large amount of players on a channel (10+) comms discipline become
        important. The channel commander may choose to call for closed comms.
        This means that players must use breaks first and wait for the channel
        commander to clear the comm in order to be able to continue. During closed
        comms all transmissions must concern the current battlefield situation. </p>
      <p><strong>Normal Break: </strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>N2deep: “Break” </p>
        <p>FuZe: “Go Break” </p>
        <p>N2deep: “This is n2deep. My team is in position”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Contact Break: </strong></p>      <blockquote>
        <p>BossHogg: “Break for contact” </p>
        <p>FuZe: “Go contact” </p>
        <p>BossHogg: “BossHogg here, I have 2 a13s north east of Zand AB, 500
          meters” </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Closed comms are not always necessary. During long trips or in other
        situations where the players are not in the combat zone” a channel commander
        may call for open comms. Players need not use breaks in order to speak
        and are free to talk about almost anything.</p>
      <p>Using these protocols, up to 40 players on a single channel may be managed
        easily. </p>
      <h4><strong>Spelling on TeamSpeak: </strong></h4>
      <p>Sometimes you may need to spell something out (like a player or town
        name) on teamspeak. Using these phonetics when spelling help you to be
        understood: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Alpha Bravo Charlie Delta Echo Foxtrot Golf Hotel India<br>
    Juliet Kilo Lima Mike November Oscar Papa Quincy Romeo <br>
      Sierra Tango Uniform Victor Whiskey Xray Yankee Zulu </p>
